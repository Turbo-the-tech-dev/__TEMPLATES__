## what is REFACTORING??
Refactoring is the process of improving the internal structure of existing code without altering its external behavior. It's like cleaning up and reorganizing your code to make it more readable, maintainable, and efficient, while ensuring it still performs the same functions.

Key points:

· Goal: Enhance code quality, reduce complexity, and make future changes easier.
· No new functionality: Refactoring does not add features; it only changes how the code is written.
· Small, safe steps: Changes are made incrementally, often with the help of automated tests to confirm behavior remains unchanged.
· Common techniques: Renaming variables for clarity, breaking large functions into smaller ones, removing duplicate code, simplifying conditionals, etc.

Refactoring is a core practice in agile development and helps keep codebases healthy over time.
